           <p>
            Zika virus (ZIKV; pronounced /ˈziːkə/ or /ˈzɪkə/[3][4]) is a member of the virus family Flaviviridae.[5] It is spread by daytime-active Aedes mosquitoes, such as A. aegypti and A. albopictus.[5] Its name comes from the Ziika Forest of Uganda, where the virus was first isolated in 1947.[6] Zika virus shares a genus with the dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile viruses.[6] Since the 1950s, it has been known to occur within a narrow equatorial belt from Africa to Asia. From 2007 to 2016, the virus spread eastward, across the Pacific Ocean to the Americas, leading to the 2015–2016 Zika virus epidemic.[7]

            The infection, known as Zika fever or Zika virus disease, often causes no or only mild symptoms, similar to a very mild form of dengue fever.[5] While there is no specific treatment, paracetamol (acetaminophen) and rest may help with the symptoms.[8] As of April 2019, no vaccines have been approved for clinical use, however a number of vaccines are currently in clinical trials.[9][10][11] Zika can spread from a pregnant woman to her baby. This can result in microcephaly, severe brain malformations, and other birth defects.[12][13] Zika infections in adults may result rarely in Guillain–Barré syndrome.[14]

            <h1>Treatment</h1>
            <p>It is advised, for an affected person with the zika virus, to drink a lot of water to stay hydrated, to lie down, and to treat the fever and agony with liquid solutions; taking drugs like acetaminophen or paracetamol helps to relieve fever and pain.[according to whom?] Referring to the US CDC it is not recommended to take anti-inflammatory and non-steroid drugs like aspirin for example.[89] If the patient affected is already taking treatment for another medical condition it is advisable to inform your attending physician before taking any other drug or additional treatment;[90]</p>
            
            <h1>HOME REMEDIES</h1>
            <p><i>1. Drink water and fluids</i> <br />
                Drinking water and other fluids is even more important when you have the flu, whether you have respiratory or stomach flu.</p>
            <br />
            <p><i>2. Get plenty of rest</i><br /> 
                Sleeping can boost your immune system, helping your body fight off the flu virus. Cancel your usual routine and make sleep a priority to get back on your feet.</p> 
            <p><i>3. Drink warm broth</i> <br />
                Drinking warm chicken or beef bone broth is a good way to stay hydrated. It also helps to loosen and break up nose and sinus congestion.</p>
            <p><i>4. Up your zinc intake</i> <br />
                The mineral zinc is important for your immune system. This nutrient helps your body make germ-fighting white blood cells.</p>
            <p><i>5. Rinse with salt water</i> <br />
                Boil or heat up water and let it cool until it's warm or at room temperature. Mix 1/2 tsp of salt with 8 ounces of warm water.
                Pull the salt water to the back of your throat and gargle it for 10 to 30 seconds to rinse your mouth and throat.</p>
            <p><i>6. Drink herbal tea</i> <br />
                Oseltamivir phosphate (better known as Tamiflu) is a prescription drug used to speed recovery from or to prevent getting the flu. Its antiviral properties are effective against some kinds of flu viruses. Other herbs and green leafy teas also have germ-fighting and antioxidant benefits.</p>
