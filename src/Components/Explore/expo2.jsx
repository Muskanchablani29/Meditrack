              Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease caused by dengue virus, prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas. It is frequently asymptomatic; if symptoms appear, they typically begin 3 to 14 days after infection. These may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin itching and skin rash. Recovery generally takes two to seven days. In a small proportion of cases, the disease develops into severe dengue (previously known as dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome)[8] with bleeding, low levels of blood platelets, blood plasma leakage, and dangerously low blood pressure.[1][2] <br />

            <h1>PUBLIC AWARENESS</h1>
            <p>International Anti-Dengue Day is observed every year on 15 June in a number of countries.[95] The idea was first agreed upon in 2010 with the first event held in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 2011.[95] Further events were held in 2012 in Yangon, Myanmar, and in 2013 in Vietnam.[95] Goals are to increase public awareness about dengue, mobilize resources for its prevention and control and, to demonstrate the Southeast Asian region's commitment in tackling the disease.[96] Efforts are ongoing as of 2019 to make it a global event.[97]

              The Philippines has an awareness month in June since 1998.[98][99]
              
              A National Dengue Day is held in India annually on 16 May.[100]</p>
            <h1>Treatment</h1>
            <p>As of July 2024, there is no specific antiviral treatment available for dengue fever.[64]

              Most cases of dengue fever have mild symptoms, and recovery takes place in a few days.[1] No treatment is required for these cases. Acetaminophen (Paracetamol, Tylenol) may be used to relieve mild fever or pain. Other common pain relievers, including aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve) should be avoided as they can increase the risk of bleeding complications.[64]
              
              For moderate illness, those who can drink, are passing urine, have no warning signs and are otherwise reasonably healthy can be monitored carefully at home. Supportive care with analgesics, fluid replacement, and bed rest are recommended.[65][23]
              
              Severe dengue is a life-threatening emergency, requiring hospitalization and potentially intensive care.[24] Warning signs include dehydration, decreasing platelets and increasing hematocrit.[66] Treatment modes include intravenous fluids, and transfusion with platelets or plasma.[65]</p>
            <h1>HOME REMEDIES</h1>
            <p><i>1. Papaya Leaves Juice</i> <br />

            <p><i>3. Drink Plenty of Water</i> <br />
              During dengue fever that causes extreme fever, body pain and weakness, patients suffer from immense fluid loss causing dehydration due to high fever and vomiting. Therefore, it is crucial that one consumes large amounts of liquids (preferably of warm or hot temperature) to keep yourself well hydrated and maintain the electrolyte balance of the body. Consuming substantial liquids ease the dengue fever symptoms, such as muscle cramps and headaches. Also, water also helps to flush out and eliminate the toxins through the fluids excreted by the body</p>
