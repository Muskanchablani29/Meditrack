           <p>
            The COVID-19 pandemic (also known as the coronavirus pandemic and COVID pandemic), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), began with an outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Soon after, it spread to other areas of Asia, and then worldwide in early 2020. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020, and assessed the outbreak as having become a pandemic on 11 March.
           </p>
        
           <h1>Transmission</h1>
           <p>The disease is mainly transmitted via the respiratory route when people inhale droplets and small airborne particles (that form an aerosol) that infected people exhale as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or sing. Infected people are more likely to transmit COVID-19 when they are physically close to other non-infected individuals. However, infection can occur over longer distances, particularly indoors.</p>
            
           <h1>Treatment</h1>
           <p>For the first two years of the pandemic, no specific and effective treatment or cure was available. In 2021, the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) approved the oral antiviral protease inhibitor, Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir plus the HIV antiviral ritonavir), to treat adult patients. FDA later gave it an EUA.

              Most cases of COVID-19 are mild. In these, supportive care includes medication such as paracetamol or NSAIDs to relieve symptoms (fever, body aches, cough), adequate intake of oral fluids and rest. Good personal hygiene and a healthy diet are also recommended.
              
              Supportive care in severe cases includes treatment to relieve symptoms, fluid therapy, oxygen support and prone positioning, and medications or devices to support other affected vital organs. More severe cases may need treatment in hospital. In those with low oxygen levels, use of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone is recommended to reduce mortality. Noninvasive ventilation and, ultimately, admission to an intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation may be required to support breathing. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the issue of respiratory failure.</p>

           <h1>HOME REMEDIES</h1>
           <p><i>At-home care for COVID-19</i> <br />
              Many people with COVID-19 get better with rest, fluids and treatment for their symptoms. Medicine you can get without a prescription can help.

              Some examples are:
              
              Fever reducers.
              Pain relievers, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others).
              Cough syrup or medicine.
              A person at high risk of serious COVID-19 illness may be offered medicine to prevent mild illness from getting worse.
              
              Groups at higher risk are people age 65 and older, babies younger than 6 months, and people with certain medical conditions. Those conditions include blood disorders and chronic diseases.
              
              If you are looking after someone with COVID-19, help the person track symptoms. You may need to help with child care or getting food and any medicine needed. And it can help to take care of the person's pet.
              
              For as long as COVID-19 symptoms get worse, stay home and apart from people who don't have COVID-19. That will help stop the spread of the virus. People with weakened immune systems may need to stay apart, also called isolate, for longer. Your healthcare professional can advise you on what's best in your situation.
              
              If you have COVID-19 and are staying separate from others, it can be stressful. You can take these actions to help your body and mind through the illness and isolation: <br />
              
              Eat healthy foods. <br />
              Get the rest you need. <br />
              Try relaxation exercises. <br />
              Keep up with hobbies you enjoy. <br />
              Connect with others through phone or video calls. <br />
              Also, if you're caring for someone with COVID-19, think about how it might affect your health. If you are age 65 or older or have chronic medical conditions, you may be at higher risk of serious illness with COVID-19.
              
              Your best protection is a recent COVID-19 vaccine. But you might think about staying apart from the person with COVID-19. If other people could provide care, that might help lower your risk. Other actions, such as increasing airflow in your living space and wearing a face mask, can help you avoid getting the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
