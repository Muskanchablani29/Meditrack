           <p>Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects vertebrates and Anopheles mosquitoes.[6][7][3] Human malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, fatigue, vomiting, and headaches.[1][8] In severe cases, it can cause jaundice, seizures, coma, or death.[1][9] Symptoms usually begin 10 to 15 days after being bitten by an infected Anopheles mosquito.[10][4] If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later.[3] In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms.[1] This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria.[1] The mosquito vector is itself harmed by Plasmodium infections, causing reduced lifespan.[11]

            Human malaria is caused by single-celled microorganisms of the Plasmodium group.[10] It is spread exclusively through bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.[10][12] The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito's saliva into a person's blood.[3] The parasites travel to the liver, where they mature and reproduce.[1] Five species of Plasmodium commonly infect humans.[10] The three species associated with more severe cases are P. falciparum (which is responsible for the vast majority of malaria deaths), P. vivax, and P. knowlesi (a simian malaria that spills over into thousands of people a year).[13][14] P. ovale and P. malariae generally cause a milder form of malaria.[1][10] Malaria is typically diagnosed by the microscopic examination of blood using blood films, or with antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests.[1] Methods that use the polymerase chain reaction to detect the parasite's DNA have been developed, but they are not widely used in areas where malaria is common, due to their cost and complexity.[15] <br />

        <h1>PUBLIC AWARENESS</h1>
        <p>International Anti-Dengue Day is observed every year on 15 June in a number of countries.[95] The idea was first agreed upon in 2010 with the first event held in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 2011.[95] Further events were held in 2012 in Yangon, Myanmar, and in 2013 in Vietnam.[95] Goals are to increase public awareness about dengue, mobilize resources for its prevention and control and, to demonstrate the Southeast Asian region's commitment in tackling the disease.[96] Efforts are ongoing as of 2019 to make it a global event.[97]

            The Philippines has an awareness month in June since 1998.[98][99]
            
            A National Dengue Day is held in India annually on 16 May.[100]</p>
            <h1>Treatment</h1>
            <p>As of July 2024, there is no specific antiviral treatment available for dengue fever.[64]

                Most cases of dengue fever have mild symptoms, and recovery takes place in a few days.[1] No treatment is required for these cases. Acetaminophen (Paracetamol, Tylenol) may be used to relieve mild fever or pain. Other common pain relievers, including aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve) should be avoided as they can increase the risk of bleeding complications.[64]
                
                For moderate illness, those who can drink, are passing urine, have no warning signs and are otherwise reasonably healthy can be monitored carefully at home. Supportive care with analgesics, fluid replacement, and bed rest are recommended.[65][23]
                
                Severe dengue is a life-threatening emergency, requiring hospitalization and potentially intensive care.[24] Warning signs include dehydration, decreasing platelets and increasing hematocrit.[66] Treatment modes include intravenous fluids, and transfusion with platelets or plasma.[65]</p>
       <h1>Treatment</h1>
       <p>Malaria is treated with antimalarial medications; the ones used depend on the type and severity of the disease.[152] While medications against fever are commonly used, their effects on outcomes are not clear.[153][154] Providing free antimalarial drugs to households may reduce childhood deaths when used appropriately. Programmes which presumptively treat all causes of fever with antimalarial drugs may lead to overuse of antimalarials and undertreat other causes of fever. Nevertheless, the use of malaria rapid-diagnostic kits can help to reduce over-usage of antimalarials.</p>
                <h1>HOME REMEDIES</h1>
        <p><i>1. Papaya Leaves Juice</i> <br />
            Pull a fresh papaya leaf from the plant and cut it into slices.
Make sure you don't remove the veins from the leaf. Mix the papaya leaves with 3 teaspoons of cold water.
Ground the mixture and strain it. </p>
<br />
<p><i>2. Tulsi Chai or Basil Leaf Tea</i><br /> 
    Tulsi leaves are considered is one of the most popular home remedies for dengue after papaya leaves for dengue. Tulsi leaf is recommended for many ailments and dengue is just one of them. Consuming tulsi ki chai or tea made from basil leaves is said to not only reduce the symptoms of dengue fever but also strengthen your immune system. Basil leaf tea is packed with cinnamic acid and magnesium, which helps in circulation of blood flow and promoting overall cardiovascular health.
</p> 
<p><i>3. Drink Plenty of Water</i> <br />
During dengue fever that causes extreme fever, body pain and weakness, patients suffer from immense fluid loss causing dehydration due to high fever and vomiting. Therefore, it is crucial that one consumes large amounts of liquids (preferably of warm or hot temperature) to keep yourself well hydrated and maintain the electrolyte balance of the body. Consuming substantial liquids ease the dengue fever symptoms, such as muscle cramps and headaches. Also, water also helps to flush out and eliminate the toxins through the fluids excreted by the body</p>
