            <p>
              Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is an infectious disease caused by influenza viruses. Symptoms range from mild to severe and often include fever, runny nose, sore throat, muscle pain, headache, coughing, and fatigue. These symptoms begin one to four (typically two) days after exposure to the virus and last for about two to eight days. Diarrhea and vomiting can occur, particularly in children. Influenza may progress to pneumonia from the virus or a subsequent bacterial infection. Other complications include acute respiratory distress syndrome, meningitis, encephalitis, and worsening of pre-existing health problems such as asthma and cardiovascular disease.

            <h1>PUBLIC AWARENESS</h1>
            <p>People who are infected can transmit influenza viruses through breathing, talking, coughing, and sneezing, which spread respiratory droplets and aerosols that contain virus particles into the air. A person susceptible to infection can contract influenza by coming into contact with these particles. Respiratory droplets are relatively large and travel less than two meters before falling onto nearby surfaces. Aerosols are smaller and remain suspended in the air longer, so they take longer to settle and can travel further. Inhalation of aerosols can lead to infection, but most transmission is in the area about two meters around an infected person via respiratory droplets that come into contact with mucosa of the upper respiratory tract. Transmission through contact with a person, bodily fluids, or intermediate objects (fomites) can also occur, since influenza viruses can survive for hours on non-porous surfaces. If one's hands are contaminated, then touching one's face can cause infection.</p>
            
            <h1>HOME REMEDIES</h1>
            <p><i>1. Drink water and fluids</i><br />
              Drinking water and other fluids is even more important when you have the flu, whether you have respiratory or stomach flu.</p>
            <br />
            <p><i>2. Get plenty of rest</i><br />
              Sleeping can boost your immune system, helping your body fight off the flu virus. Cancel your usual routine and make sleep a priority to get back on your feet.</p>
            <p><i>3. Drink warm broth</i><br />
              Drinking warm chicken or beef bone broth is a good way to stay hydrated. It also helps to loosen and break up nose and sinus congestion.</p>
            <p><i>4. Up your zinc intake</i><br />
              The mineral zinc is important for your immune system. This nutrient helps your body make germ-fighting white blood cells.</p>
            <p><i>5. Rinse with salt water</i><br />
              Boil or heat up water and let it cool until it's warm or at room temperature. Mix 1/2 tsp of salt with 8 ounces of warm water.
              Pull the salt water to the back of your throat and gargle it for 10 to 30 seconds to rinse your mouth and throat.</p>
            <p><i>6. Drink herbal tea</i><br />
              Oseltamivir phosphate (better known as Tamiflu) is a prescription drug used to speed recovery from or to prevent getting the flu. Its antiviral properties are effective against some kinds of flu viruses. Other herbs and green leafy teas also have germ-fighting and antioxidant benefits.</p>
